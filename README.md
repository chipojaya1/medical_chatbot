## New Prototype: Data Science Career Copilot

To support aspiring data scientists, the repository now also contains a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype built with Flask (`app/`). The service indexes curated Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Glassdoor insights stored in `data/rag_corpus.json` and exposes a `/ask` endpoint plus a minimal chat interface. Each response surfaces bullet-point guidance with explicit source citations, aligning with the transparency requirement for career-planning research.

### Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app.app run
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> to chat with the assistant. Provide questions about entry-level salaries, required skills, hiring trends, or interview preparation to receive sourced answers.

## Executive Summary

Our project aimed to develop an intelligent medical chatbot that provides reliable symptom assessment and disease suggestions using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). The chatbot helps bridge the gap between initial symptom research and professional medical consultation by offering immediate, easy-to-understand information about possible health conditions.

We implemented three distinct technical approaches: a rule-based chatbot using cosine similarity, a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with medical domain LLMs, and fine-tuned LLMs using QLoRA. The system processes user-described symptoms and suggests potential conditions while emphasizing the importance of professional medical consultation.

## Problem Understanding

When people feel unwell, they often search online to understand their symptoms but face confusing and sometimes unreliable medical information. Visiting a doctor isn't always immediately possible, especially in remote areas or during off-hours. This creates several challenges:

**Key Pain Points:**
- üîç **Information Overload**: Online medical information is overwhelming and often contradictory
- ‚è∞ **Access Barriers**: Doctor appointments can take days/weeks, emergency rooms are overcrowded
- üåç **Geographic Limitations**: Rural areas have limited access to medical specialists
- üí∞ **Cost Concerns**: Many avoid doctor visits due to cost, leading to delayed diagnosis

**User Needs:**
- "I have these symptoms - should I be worried?"
- "Is this serious enough to see a doctor?"
- "What could be causing these symptoms?"

Our medical chatbot addresses these needs by providing immediate, reliable symptom assessment while always emphasizing professional medical consultation.

## Data Collection and Pre-processing

**1. Data Collection:**   
The primary dataset was sourced from Kaggle: [Disease Symptom Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction) containing 313 unique disease entries with symptom combinations. The dataset includes comprehensive symptom-disease mappings for common medical conditions.

**2. Data Cleaning & Pre-processing:**  
We implemented extensive data preprocessing:
- **Text Normalization**: Removed underscores from symptom descriptions ("muscle_wasting" ‚Üí "muscle wasting")
- **Data Transformation**: Combined multiple symptom columns into comma-separated lists
- **Deduplication**: Removed duplicate symptom patterns while preserving disease coverage
- **Formatting**: Structured data for LLM training with proper prompt templates

**3. Data Structure:**
- **Format**: Disease ‚Üí Multiple symptom combinations (up to 17 symptoms per disease)
- **Size**: 313 unique disease entries
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive common conditions with varied symptom presentations

## The AI Models

### Three Technical Approaches Implemented:

**1. Rule-Based Chatbot (Cosine Similarity)**
- **Technique**: TF-IDF vectorization + Cosine similarity matching
- **Pros**: Fast, interpretable, no training required
- **Cons**: Limited to exact keyword matches, no semantic understanding

**2. RAG System (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- **Technique**: Sentence embeddings + Semantic search + LLM generation
- **Models Used**: BioMistral-7B (medical domain LLM), SentenceTransformers
- **Pros**: Context-aware, handles synonyms and semantic meaning
- **Cons**: Computationally intensive, requires GPU resources

**3. Fine-tuned LLM (QLoRA)**
- **Technique**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with 4-bit quantization
- **Models**: Llama-2-7B-Chat and BioMistral-7B with QLoRA
- **Pros**: Domain-specific optimization, faster inference
- **Cons**: Training complexity, potential overfitting

### Model Performance Comparison:

| Method | Accuracy | Response Time | Resource Usage |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Rule-based | ~65% | <1 second | Low CPU |
| RAG System | ~78% | 5-10 seconds | High GPU |
| Fine-tuned LLM | ~82% | 2-5 seconds | Medium GPU |

5. **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** - QLoRA implementation
6. **BitsAndBytes** - 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency

### Key Features

**User Interface:**
- Simple text-based interaction
